This is a javascript project I made for Simple Modern. The project is intended to be used as a means of training new hires and/or testing your knowledge of Simple Modern products. To begin the game, press the start button. The program then shows user an image of a Simple Modern product. Below the image is a title describing what "subject" the question is, three buttons appear with choices pertaining to the product image. Only one button is correct while two are incorrect unique options.


Answer as many as you can (correctly!) in the alloted time to finish on top!

NOTE: score = correct - wrong
