This is a javascript project I made for Simple Modern. The project is intended to be used as a means of training new hires and/or testing your knowledge of Simple Modern products. To begin the game, press the start button. The program then shows user an image of a Simple Modern product. Above the image is a title describing what "subject" the question is. Below the image three buttons appear with choices pertaining to said subject. Only one button is correct while two are incorrect unique options.
